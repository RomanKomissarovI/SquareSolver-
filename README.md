### Tests
Also this programm has tests. If you want to use built-in tests, print `.\main.exe tests`. If you want to check the program with your tests, you shold make a txt-file with 6 numbers in each string of the format: `a b c first_root second_root number_of_roots`. If the equation has no solutions, `x1` = `x2` = 0, if only one - `x1` = `x2` = x. Then, type `.\main.exe --file <path to file>`.
